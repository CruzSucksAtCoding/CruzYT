## ðŸ‘€ Hey there, and welcome to my github page!
#### - Hello. My name's Cruz. I like coding Discord bots, and playing Minecraft, a few months ago I was seeing people make there own Discord Bots. So I decided I should try. I watched a couple of tutorial's and then coded a bot with the knowledge from those videos. On here I plan to upload projects I do later in the future, and maybe tutorials. Thank you for reading...
